Is this happen to you when you don't know what should you do for tomorrow or weekend and also done you work?
This happen when you don't have any schedule for your life. Grab a paper and a pen, write your tomorrow tasks, write your weekend tasks, write what you wanna do until a period of time, 2 weeks, one month, or whatever. so when you wrote your task list, your schedule for next month, oh... you suddenly remember lost something to write. yes, you can't edit the note on paper, add something to it or you can't set reminders or you can't set alarm for your goals, it is not impossible on paper, but it's easier with SimpleScheduler.
